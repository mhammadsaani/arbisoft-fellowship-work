### Floor Division vs int()

## Floor division is almost similar to converting a float to integer using int()

# print(10//3)
# print(int(10/3))

## Floor division is not same as floor and ceil math operations

# import math 
# num = 10.5
# print(math.floor(num))
# print(math.ceil(num))


### Full Sopport for Floating Points

## if expression have floats and integers, then they all are treated as floats and operations are performed

# expression = 2 * (9.2 * 5)
# print(expression)

### Strings 

## string concatenation 

# text = 'a' 'b' # two strings next to each other
# print(text)

# text = (
# #         'a quick brown fox'
# #         'jumps over the lazy dog'
# #         )

# # print(text)

### Lists

## List concatenation

# _list = [1, 2, 3]
# _list = _list + [4, 5, 6]
# print(_list)

## replacing values in list

# _list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# _list[2:4] = [10, 20]
# print(_list)

## making list empty 

# _list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# _list[:] = []
# print(_list)
