### interactive mode vs script execution mode

## Underscore _ in interactive mode

##  -c and -m flags (some modules are useful as scripts)

## i flag can be used to enter in module interactive mode after script has been executed


### sys and vector/list of arguments

# import sys

# print(sys.argv[0]) # file name

# for i in sys.argv:
#     print(i)
